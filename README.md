# UVA GPT
Providing ðŸ“• course, ðŸ§¢ club, ðŸ§ª research and ðŸŽ‰ event information to UVA students.

---

The main script is the [index.ts](functions/src/index.ts) which contains the code to interface with the custom gpt model.

## Design and Learnings

I had previously took an existing, complicated API with many required paramters. I had limited success as the model was always inconsistent to call this function with default values. So, wrapping API calls in streamlined cloud function can make them far more palleteable for the Custom GPT.

## Talking the Same Language

Custom GPTs use the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) standard to describe inputs and outputs. GPT-4 was used to generate this standard and connect it with the custom gpt.
