S4H focuses specifically on pediatric oncology patients, and works with partnering companies to provide children in various areas nationwide with the opportunity to custom paint a pair of Nike Air Force Ones. These shoes are then worn by the coaching staff, and other leadership during a game, with each coach or individual wearing a unique pair created by one of the participating children. After the game, the shoes are signed, returned to S4H, and donated to local health systems, which auction them off to raise funds for their pediatric oncology departments.In addition to the shoe painting, participating children are given tickets to a game, stadium tours, access to a basketball practice and halftime recognition during the aforementioned game. S4H aims to increase public awareness of pediatric cancer and provide children with the chance to express themselves creatively, while also bringing attention to an underfunded area of cancer research. tags Public Service members 0\n"

The issues that arise are truly cutting-edge and comprise many of the growth areas in professional practice and academic scholarship today. A technical or science background is not required in order to thrive on the journal.

It also creates opportunities for cross-disciplinary interaction, allowing students to learn from diverse fields, thereby enriching their research projects and broadening their intellectual horizons. The presence of such an organization in a university also helps bridge the gap between various academic programs, fostering a cohesive intellectual community. This environment of academic enrichment, facilitated by the Legal Research Forum, is vital for nurturing well-rounded, critically-thinking legal professionals who can contribute meaningfully to the legal eld and society at large.

There is no “right” time to get started, your college experience is your own and you should pursue a research or creative endeavor when you feel prepared to incorporate it into your schedule. That said, finding an opportunity is a journey in itself. It will take thought, effort, and likely a bit of time to find the right fit.How can I get started?

      "name United2Heal at UVA description United2Heal at UVA is working to reduce the disparities in treatment quality between privileged and underprivileged areas of the world by providing overseas health care workers with the basic medical resources they need to save and improve lives. To this end, our organization reaches out to local hospitals and clinics, and accepts in-kind donations of medical goods. Medical equipment considered unusable by strict U.S. packaging and expiration regulations can still be effectively used abroad. Moreover, many medical organizations have no established program or protocol to donate surplus resources. Last academic year, we collected nearly $180,000 worth of medical supplies that otherwise would have been needlessly wasted and, with the help of our sister chapter at VCU, shipped the donations to Haiti. The long-term vision we have for this program isn’t just to manage a static set of supply chains. We intend to turn United2Heal into an umbrella organization providing medical supplies and financing to student-led humanitarian efforts. Future undergraduate students will have the opportunity to lead their own initiatives with our organization serving in a support role. Ultimately, the purpose of executive board members will be to secure medical supplies from local contacts, review student proposals of equipment use, and financing shipping to the destination country. Although this organization has members who are University of Virginia students and may have, University employees associated or engaged in its activities and affairs, the organization is not a part of or an agency. It is a separate and independent organization, which is responsible for and manages its own activities and affairs. The University does not direct, supervise or control the organization and is not responsible for the organization’s contracts, acts or omissions.  tags Public Service, Contracted Independent Organization (CIO) members 24\n"

However, the strong bonds between members mixed with the unique co-ed atmosphere kept NewDos together, over the years transforming NewDos into what it is today.

We have been to some amazing places and experienced some incredible things, but at our core, we are a group of folks who love to sing. tags Contracted Independent Organization (CIO), Social & Hobby, Visual & Performing Arts members 14\n"

      "name Virginia Journal of International Law description The Virginia Journal of International Law is one of the top ranked international law journals in the world. Founded in 1960, we are located at the University of Virginia School of Law in Charlottesville, Virginia. We publish three times annually, and our issues contain Articles, Notes, and Essays. We also host an annual symposium.For an overview of who we are, where we've been, and our contributions to the field of international law, please read then-Dean Paul Mahoney's commemorative letter from the fiftieth anniversary Volume in 2010, copied below:\"We are all internationalists now. Fifty years ago, when the Virginia Journal of International Law began publication, international law was a narrowly-defined field concerned with the legal obligations of nation states vis-à-vis one another. International law scholars had relatively little to say to their domestic law counterparts and vice versa. Scholars of comparative law, although engaged in an analytically different exercise, shared much of the culture of international lawyers and published in the same journals, including VJIL. Today the barriers between international and domestic law are diminishing. In part, this is a simple result of the dramatic growth in cross-border movements of people and capital. But it is also, interestingly, a consequence of intellectual and cultural conflict between international and domestic law. Reflecting its origins, international law has a decidedly European sensibility. That sensibility is frequently out of step with American domestic law on matters relating to war, criminal punishment, the environment, and so on. It therefore matters whether international law limits or informs domestic law on those issues. In recent years, U.S. courts have partly opened the door to such influence. Barring a reversal of that trend or a substantial cultural shift on one side of the Atlantic or the other, the underlying policy conflicts will guarantee increasing debate between international and domestic law scholars. The era when each could ignore the other’s substantive commitments is over. A third reason for the convergence is methodological. International and comparative scholars were relative latecomers to the interdisciplinary movement in legal scholarship. More recently, international law scholars have come to rely on insights from international relations theory, which is in turn informed by game theory and institutional economics. The methodological distance between international law and domestic law scholarship, which widened with the creation of “law and” movements in the middle of the last century, has narrowed again. If international law scholars found political science and economics, we might say that economics found comparative law. In the past decade there has been an explosion of empirical work in macroeconomics that looks for the determinants of cross-country differences in the organization and operation of the economy. A striking conclusion of that literature is that the design of a country’s legal system is strongly related to the organization of its financial, product, and labor markets. This has sparked an outpouring of interest among economists in the differences among legal systems. Comparative law scholars have not been entirely welcoming of this interest, but here too it seems clear that the barriers separating comparative law and previously domestically-focused law and economics are breaking down. We can see the results in the pages of recent issues of VJIL, which discuss financial and environmental regulation, intellectual property, antitrust, and taxation, each only dimly on the minds of internationalists fifty years ago. This widening of the interests and concerns of international and comparative law is healthy and bodes well for the intellectual promise of VJIL’s next fifty years. VJIL has been a major forum for the development of scholarly ideas about international and comparative law over the past fifty years, and I congratulate the Journal and its editors, past and present, for their contribution to the advancement of those fields. I have no doubt that the future will be equally bright.\" tags Media & Publications, Academic & Professional, Contracted Independent Organization (CIO), Law School members 40\n",

Our mission is to support an engaged citizenry by fostering an open marketplace of ideas and encouraging the productive exchange of political speech.Seriatim was conceived in the winter of 2012 and founded on a simple premise: everyone has a voice. We hope to provide an avenue through which the genuine political speech of undergraduate students may better be heard and shared with the community at large. Thus, Seriatim was born—an attempt to tangibly create Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes’s conception of the “marketplace of ideas,” in which different opinions freely compete for the validation of the many. By using academic papers as well as original work, we hope to bring greater meaning to students’ work inside the classroom by making it accessible to a wider audience. We encourage you to contribute to the undergraduate marketplace of ideas, either by submitting a paper you wrote for your politics class or by writing an original article on an issue of your choosing.Jefferson once said of the University, “For here we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it.” At Seriatim, we seek to embody this ideal, and we invite you to join us along the way. tags Political & Advocacy, Academic & Professional, Contracted Independent Organization (CIO), Media & Publications members 23\n",

      "name Alpha Phi Omega - Theta Chapter description Alpha Phi Omega is a gender-inclusive service fraternity that provides community service to the Charlottesville area and beyond. We put an emphasis on prioritizing the needs of all of our sites to ensure we can provide the best service possible, and we encourage all members to both find meaning with our several service opportunities like Midweeks (~1 hour long service projects during the week) and Saturday Projects (~3 hour long service projects on Saturdays), and to put in the effort to actually get to know all of our various sites. At the same time, we also have an active social aspect of our chapter as we encourage all members to get to know one another and bond through several social events throughout the semester. Members also have numerous opportunities to work on leadership skills, both within the organization and during our service projects, as we believe leading is one of the best ways to provide the best service.

However, we know firsthand that, whether it is due to immigration, socioeconomic status, or a simple lack of exposure, there are so many “in-betweeners,” and guidance is critical. We aim to holistically support the generation of students that are first in their family to be exposed to the complexities of higher education through maximizing their knowledge and application of skills that are imperative to multi-dimensional career success. Through a bottom-up approach, we will guide students through the ins and outs of finding, earning, and multiplying opportunities geared toward the career path of their choosing as well as encouraging exploration of the disparities within that field, thereby making them eager to suture some gap. Using a vertical mentorship system, each student will have a mentor who will guide them to acquiring and applying skills necessary to excel at a large institution (including but not limited to networking, discovering low-cost resources, improving study methods, and general success strategies). Further, we understand the difficult transition into college, and we hope for all members to find a community of support within us.

We take a broad approach to the term politics – in addition to covering formal and electoral politics, our writers examine arts and literature, science and technology, social movements, public health, the environment, and a host of other topics. In doing so, we seek to prompt discussion among policy wonks and newcomers alike. The Review is an omni-partisan platform, which means that our pieces span a diverse array of intellectual and political backgrounds. By giving students an outlet for creative expression and experimentation, we hope to widen the scope of who is allowed to speak on contemporary affairs. We do not deny that our content is politically charged – in fact, that is one of our defining features. However, the articles we publish are meant to reflect only the opinions of their authors, and not the official stance of the Review.  tags Academic & Professional, Contracted Independent Organization (CIO), Political & Advocacy, Media & Publications members 15\n",

      "name TEDx UVA description Hey TedHeads, thank you for your interest in TEDx at UVA! In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. These events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. TEDx at UVA put on its first event in April 2012 and has hosted a conference every year since. Our conference includes students, professors, and outside professionals as speakers. Members of TEDx do not speak at our events, we are in different teams that work towards organizing our conference. Below are descriptions of each committee:Speakers: Members of the Speakers Committee recruit, organize, and oversee all speakers of our TEDx conferences. In the Fall, the Speakers Committee will mentor student speakers; this involves editing TED talks (strong writing skills necessary), writing and responding to emails efficiently, and providing advice to student speakers in a one-on-one mentoring setting. In the spring, members of Speakers are responsible for recruiting TEDx speakers and mentoring them in writing their TED talks. Members of the committee must be comfortable communicating in a professional and prompt manner and will be working in a very small group setting.Sponsorship: The Sponsorship Committee handles the sourcing and using of the organization's funds. As a member of the Sponsorship Team, you will be involved in developing and managing the club's budget, applying for grants and managing relationships with corporate partners, and creating ways to find and use funds strategically. The role is perfect for someone with an interest in finance and gives you a very unique view of the club's operation and management.Outreach: The job of this committee would broadly be to engage with the University community in ways other than Student Speaker Conference and the Main Conference. This would entail the continued publication of a newsletter for the TEDx community as well as collaborations with other groups on grounds to promote ideas worth spreading. The exciting thing about this committee is that it acts nearly independently and requires creativity, allowing the members to have a huge amount of latitude in the direction of the committee.Graphics and Marketing:The role of the Graphics committee is to facilitate communication between the organization and the University community. Members of this committee will be responsible for managing social media accounts, our website, and our on-Ground presence through flyering, chalking, and creating outreach videos. In addition, committee members will be creating graphics through various software programs, developing ideas, and producing various marketing campaigns to be implemented on-Grounds for TEDx sponsored events.Logistics: The logistics committee is concerned with the behind the scenes of the two conferences. Being on this committee involves creating the decorations, designing the stage, and organizing venues. Logistics members need to have a strong sense of design, communication, and organizational skills in order to make the conferences run smoothly.

      "name Awaaz at the University of Virginia description It is often difficult for South Asian young adults to seek help due to a heightened societal stigma surrounding mental health in South Asian communities. This leads to elevated feelings of distress and helplessness as mental health issues are usually marginalized and cast aside within the community. Thus, Awaaz– meaning “Voice'' in many South Asian languages– started with the goal of providing South Asian students with a safe space for communication regarding unique discussion topics while building awareness about mental health issues and providing support to the South Asian community. It is especially difficult for South Asian students to seek professional help such as therapy services, a practice that is not viewed favorably by older generations. Awaaz aims to create a supportive group atmosphere where student confidentiality is non-negotiable so that interested students can seek help and connections worry-free. By being a member of this organization, students will have the opportunity to share their own experiences and relate to others on a more personal level. Furthermore, we hope that the new connections forged within this organization will allow students to reach out to trusted individuals within the Awaaz community in times of need. Overall, Awaaz hopes to break down barriers that are in the way of South Asian students seeking mental health related resources. tags Contracted Independent Organization (CIO), Cultural & Ethnic, No Application or Interview Required members 6\n"

The current president founded an online platform to help both herself and other students to express their anxieties and pressure through this anonymous platform. She made a Google Form to collect students’ responses and post them on Wechat every week. Soon it became popular among certain student groups and some students came together to found this organization as it is now. Weekly Wechat push has become a regular event for our organization. After the organization was created, our organization also sought for other ways that engage Chinese students to share their daily life and facilitate a sense of belonging at UVA. For instance, some students would make cooking tutorials videos for us. Pets videos are popular in our Wechat push as well. In order to provide those who are interested in pets more information about keeping a pet, we make videos of the pets from Chinese students. These videos are all distributed online via the Wechat. Apart from video-featured columns, our organization decided to initiate discussions of common social issues among students to help relieve stresses and enlighten them. The topics of discussions we have initiated include depression and eating disorder. By collecting and posting anonymous response from students who have experienced similar issues, we tried to let other people be more aware of the issue and keep an eye on themselves and people around them. tags Contracted Independent Organization (CIO), Social & Hobby members 10\n",

      "name The All Girls STEM Society at UVA description The All Girls STEM Society was established originally in San Diego, California, with the sole intent of encouraging young women to pursue careers in STEM fields - areas where they were grossly underrepresented. The organization brought student volunteers from all backgrounds and walks of life to help further this goal. Upon arriving in Virginia, the All Girls STEM Society decided to expand its vision, deciding to focus on not only young women but also students of color and underprivileged students who are often not given the same opportunities to find their passion in scientific fields. The All Girls STEM Society’s goal is to help students find their own passion in STEM. We hope that all students involved in our events go on to the STEM fields; yet, if even a fraction are inspired, then we will meet our goal. It is with great pride the Society brings this mission to the University of Virginia, in hopes of continuing to contribute positively to the academic community. tags Contracted Independent Organization (CIO), Public Service members 21\n"

The nostalgia in food is an important way to remember where one comes from and is a way to share a very \"human\" and personal part of one's culture. Taste of Home organizes pop-up food events where chefs from the immigrant, refugee, or asylum-seeking communities cook for us.  Chefs are fully compensated for each pop up they cook for and this additional source of income can be very important to some families. It can also foster new friendships with the wider Charlottesville community and build work experience in the U.S. If food is the common denominator that all cultures share, it has the potential to cure the \"us and them\" mentality.  tags Contracted Independent Organization (CIO), Cultural & Ethnic, Public Service members 17\n",
